## AI-Powered Developer Assistant for Visual Studio Code

**Triminds VectorAI** is an AI-powered Visual Studio Code extension that enhances developer productivity through semantic search, embedding generation and intelligent code assistance directly inside the editor.

Unlike the enterprise applications in the Triminds ecosystem, **VectorAI is a standalone developer tool**. It is designed to assist software engineers building modern AI applications, including the Triminds products themselves.

---

# 🌐 Part of the Triminds Ecosystem

Triminds VectorAI is one of the engineering tools developed within the **Triminds** ecosystem.

Rather than consuming services from the Triminds Platform, VectorAI supports the development of the entire ecosystem by providing AI-assisted coding capabilities directly inside Visual Studio Code.

# 🚀 Overview

VectorAI brings modern AI capabilities directly into the development environment through semantic search, vector embeddings and intelligent developer assistance.

The extension targets developers building applications involving:

* Large Language Models (LLMs)
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Vector Databases
* Semantic Search
* AI-powered Software Engineering
* PostgreSQL + pgvector
* Embedding-based Architectures

Built with TypeScript and the Visual Studio Code Extension API, VectorAI integrates modern AI models with a lightweight and extensible architecture.

# 🌟 Role within the Triminds Ecosystem

Unlike the enterprise applications developed by Triminds, **VectorAI is an engineering productivity tool**.

Its mission is to accelerate the development of AI solutions by providing intelligent capabilities directly inside the IDE.

As new Triminds products evolve, VectorAI evolves alongside them—helping developers build, test and maintain high-quality software through reusable AI-assisted workflows.

This independent architecture allows VectorAI to be adopted in any software project, whether inside or outside the Triminds ecosystem.
